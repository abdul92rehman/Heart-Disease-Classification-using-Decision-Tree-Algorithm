Heart Disease Classification using Decision Tree Algorithm
The main Objective of this Study is to develop a model that can classify that whether a patient is suffering from Heart disease based on the existing attributes like age, cholesterol, diabetes, hyper pressure.
Variables are:
1- age
2- sex
3- chest pain type (4 values)
4- resting blood pressure
5- serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6- fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7- resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8- maximum heart rate achieved
9- exercise induced angina
10- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12- number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
